## 🔍 About Me

I'm Tooba — a data scientist and PhD researcher focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Neuro-Symbolic AI** in the healthcare domain. I thrive at the intersection of AI research and real-world applications, especially in sensitive fields like **newborn care**, where intelligent systems can make life-saving impacts.

With 3+ years of experience, I’ve:
- Delivered **40+ freelance data science projects** across finance, retail, healthcare, NLP, and more
- Published in **IEEE** on Flight Delay Prediction using Gradient Boosting
- Built LSTM models for financial forecasting and recommender systems for streaming platforms
- Taught **UK college-level students** and international clients data science, AI, and Python
- Led outreach workshops to **encourage STEM for school-aged girls across the UK**
- Consulted on real business cases in **fraud detection**, **churn prediction**, **insurance modeling**, and **AI-based recruitment**
